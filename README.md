# python-case-studies
I have done a course on **Foundations of Data Science** from [**PadhAI - One Fourth Labs**](https://padhai.onefourthlabs.in/). This repository has some problems and case studies from that course and will eventually add other also with detailed description. I highly recommend doing this course if you are beginner in this field.
Let's begin.

I ll keep you posted. Keep visiting.
